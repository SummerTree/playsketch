=========
LATER
=========

Do prettier lines (use point sprite brush instead of line drawings)

- drawing should throw away points that are too near the previous one

- drawing should be prettier and use a stamp

- Explore: using msmutabledata's bytes as line point backing (avoiding weird copy back/forward stuff)

- Turn off full draw loop when we aren't animating (to maximize drawing responsiveness)


- Document picker screen
	- buttons have actual images of the drawing!!!

	- delete button confirm dialog

	- nicer animations

EVEN LATER

- Multiple documents (with their own root stores, etc)

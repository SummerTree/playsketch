handle for rotation?



detailview:
- shade out things that aren't in background



- video export
- minimum size for manipulator
- button for rotation
- toolbar should be better placed


for selection line to not be created IN the model:

- port basemodel semantics
	- timeline
	- relative locations etc
	- playback
	- animation

LINE DRAWING:
	- eraser
	- fountain-pen style drawing, where speed affects width.
	- pen width in general
	- touching single point?

IMPROVED GRAPHICS:
	- selection line and selection can use a hash patter that moves across them!
	- background texture for drawing lines, too

- Turn off full draw loop when we aren't animating (to maximize drawing responsiveness)

- UNDO/REDO

- Document picker screen
	- delete button confirm dialog
	- nicer animations
	
- should have some "offstage" workspace beyond the bounds of what is recorded for placing objects.

BUGS:
transforms not saved
lines need to be drawn in a fixed order which that order should be respected when changing groups.

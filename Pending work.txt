selection line & highlight lines are marching ants


1) Just selected
	- lines still selected!
	


2) selected character

3) unselected character
	- as is: no outline, grey background square.

4) recording character


- selection style should change between characters and just selections
	- just selection should keep the selected style probably?
- button / graphic for making a character



- video export
- eraser!


MILESTONE 4:
- clicking the button pushes a detail view
- dismiss detail view
- drawing in detail view (pause rendering on 

	
MILESTONE 4:
	puppets inside the animation



for selection line to not be created IN the model:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3576743/core-data-create-multiple-managed-objects-but-only-save-some



- port basemodel semantics
	- timeline
	- relative locations etc
	- playback
	- animation

=========
LATER
=========

- eraser

- fountain-pen style drawing, where speed affects width.

- pen width in general

- touching single point?

- selection line and selection can use a hash patter that moves across them!

- Explore: using msmutabledata's bytes as line point backing (avoiding weird copy back/forward stuff)

- Turn off full draw loop when we aren't animating (to maximize drawing responsiveness)

- UNDO/REDO

- Document picker screen

	- delete button confirm dialog

	- nicer animations
	
- add texture to highlighting to make it look better!

- should have some "offstage" workspace beyond the bounds of what is recorded for placing objects.

NOTES

This is the style guide people should follow:

BUGS:
transforms not saved
image previews look like crap
lines need to be drawn in a fixed order
that order should be respected when changing groups.

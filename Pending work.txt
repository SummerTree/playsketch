MILESTONE 3

- time clock
- store positions
- interpolate based on time clock
- button to reset time clock

aniimation widget animates drawing
	design data structures for TimeLists
	Implementent them in coredata
	test TimeLists
	basic timeline

MILESTONE 4:
- clicking the button pushes a detail view
- dismiss detail view
- drawing in detail view (pause rendering on 

	
MILESTONE 4:
	puppets inside the animation



for selection line to not be created IN the model:

- port basemodel semantics
	- timeline
	- relative locations etc
	- playback
	- animation

=========
LATER
=========

- eraser

- fountain-pen style drawing, where speed affects width.

- pen width in general

- touching single point?

- selection line and selection can use a hash patter that moves across them!

- Explore: using msmutabledata's bytes as line point backing (avoiding weird copy back/forward stuff)

- Turn off full draw loop when we aren't animating (to maximize drawing responsiveness)


- Document picker screen

	- delete button confirm dialog

	- nicer animations

EVEN LATER
========
- Multiple documents (with their own root stores, etc)

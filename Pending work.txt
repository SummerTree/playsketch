- Configure basic Core Data model:

	Drawing group
		children groups
		drawing item set
		position info
		
		

- Create GLKit view controller & view, set to root item


- Render lines (with temp lines)


- Use view's touches to create new lines


- animations....


- Multiple documents (with their own root stores, etc)

Should create a container view controller (custom uiviewcontroller subclass) to contain our GLview.

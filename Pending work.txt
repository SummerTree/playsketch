NEXT:
Detailview
button
pushes new view
inherits new frame of reference
(recursive!)




Odds + ends

Drawing stuff:
- Nicer selection background
- nicer drawing texture?

- video export
- eraser!

- minimum size for manipulator
- button for rotation
- toolbar should be better placed


for selection line to not be created IN the model:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3576743/core-data-create-multiple-managed-objects-but-only-save-some



- port basemodel semantics
	- timeline
	- relative locations etc
	- playback
	- animation

=========
LATER
=========

- eraser

- fountain-pen style drawing, where speed affects width.

- pen width in general

- touching single point?

- selection line and selection can use a hash patter that moves across them!

- Explore: using msmutabledata's bytes as line point backing (avoiding weird copy back/forward stuff)

- Turn off full draw loop when we aren't animating (to maximize drawing responsiveness)

- UNDO/REDO

- Document picker screen

	- delete button confirm dialog

	- nicer animations
	
- add texture to highlighting to make it look better!

- should have some "offstage" workspace beyond the bounds of what is recorded for placing objects.

BUGS:
transforms not saved
image previews look like crap
lines need to be drawn in a fixed order
that order should be respected when changing groups.
